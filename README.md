The Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to manage the operations of a library. The system facilitates seamless interaction between library users and administrators by providing functionalities such as user registration, login, book search, and book management. This project aims to simplify the process of managing books and users while enhancing the user experience with modern web technologies.
